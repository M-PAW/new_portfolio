# new_portfolio
My new portfolio website, in development, and soon to replace my current website. I plan to implement TDD, redux state management, animations, it will be fully responsive, and I will attempt to integrate my projects into this projects so that they can be run on the same host.  A bit thank you to David Pok, your portfolio inspired me to do better with mine. David can be found here, https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpok/
